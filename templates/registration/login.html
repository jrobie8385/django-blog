<!--
We’re using HTML <form></form> tags and specifying the POST method since we’re
sending data to the server (we’d use GET if we were requesting data, such as in a
search engine form). We add {% csrf_token %} for security concerns, namely to
prevent a XSS Attack. The form’s contents are outputted between paragraph tags
thanks to {{ form.as_p }} and then we add a “submit” button.
