    By default DetailView will provide a context object
    we can use in our template called either object or the lowercased name of our model,
    which would be 'post'. Also, DetailView expects either a primary key or a slug passed
    to it as the identifier.

    If you find using post or object confusing, itâ€™s possible to explicitly name the context
    object in our view using context_object_name.
